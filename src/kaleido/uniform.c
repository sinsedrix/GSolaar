 *	List of Uniform Polyhedra and Their Kaleidoscopic Formulae
 *	==========================================================
 *
 *	Each entry contains the following items:
 *
 *	1)	Wythoff symbol.
 *	2)	Polyhedron name.
 *	3)	Dual name.
 *	4)	Coxeter &al. reference figure.
 *	5)	Wenninger reference figure.
 *
 *	Notes:
 *
 *	(1)	Cundy&Roulette's trapezohedron has been renamed to
 *		deltohedron, as its faces are deltoids, not trapezoids.
 *	(2)	The names of the non-dihedral polyhedra are those
 *		which appear in Wenninger (1984). Some of them are
 *		slightly modified versions of those in Wenninger (1971).
